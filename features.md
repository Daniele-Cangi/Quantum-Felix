## üêà Quantum Early Stopping

### Revolutionary Approach
Our unique quantum-inspired early stopping mechanism uses probability amplitudes to make more intelligent training decisions:

```python
class QuantumEarlyStopping:
    def __init__(self):
        self.psi_alive = 1.0  # Continue training amplitude
        self.psi_dead = 0.0   # Stop training amplitude
        
    def update_state(self, fidelity, improvement):
        # Update quantum state based on training progress
        self.collapse_probability = self.calculate_collapse(
            fidelity, improvement
        )
```

### Key Benefits
- **Probabilistic decisions** instead of hard thresholds
- **Fidelity-based assessment** of training quality  
- **Adaptive stopping criteria** that learn from training history
- **Reduced overfitting** through intelligent exploration-exploitation balance
